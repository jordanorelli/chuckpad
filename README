ChucKPad is a project that aims to explore the abilities of the Novation
Launchpad using the ChucK programming language.  If you are unfamiliar with
the programming environment, head on over to the ChucK homepage:

You can launch the ChucKPad suite by chucking the startup.ck file.
startup.ck will include each of the required ChucK files and set the program
in motion.

At this time (Nov 28 2010) the suite consists of two programs: TouchPad and
ToneMatrix.  

TouchPad is a polyphonic synthesizer that lets you play your Launchpad as a
straight controller.  Right now it just controls an array of sine oscillators,
and there aren't any runtime options like tuning or tembre.  Those will be
added in time.  The lowest note is set to 110Hz (A2) and is located in the
bottom left corner.  Moving to the right, each square is a semitone above the
previous.  Moving vertically, each square is a minor sixth (eight semitones)
higher than the one below it.  The ergonomics are impossible, but it's a start.

ToneMatrix is based on the Flash app of the same name over Laboratory Andre
Michelle (http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix).  I added a visual cursor
just to make things a little more apparent.  There's no way to change the
waveform or row step at runtime (it's set to tritones at the moment), but I
have that in mind for a future update.
